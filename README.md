Fourier Transform and Image Filtering using MATLAB

Developed an advanced image processing project leveraging the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to analyze and manipulate image data.
Implemented frequency domain transformations to extract critical image features, including magnitude spectrum and phase spectrum, enabling efficient pattern recognition and noise reduction.
Applied various filtering techniques such as Gaussian low-pass filters, high-pass filters, and Butterworth filters, achieving significant improvement in image clarity and feature enhancement.
Automated the process of adding noise, transforming images into the frequency domain, applying filters, and reconstructing images through the Inverse Fourier Transform (IDFT).
Utilized MATLAB for zero-padding and spectral centering to optimize resolution and reduce convolution artifacts.
Contributed to real-world applications such as image restoration, compression, and segmentation, demonstrating expertise in both mathematical principles and practical implementations.

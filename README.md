Fourier Transform and Image Filtering using MATLAB

(1)-Developed an advanced image processing project leveraging the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to analyze and manipulate image data.

(2)-Implemented frequency domain transformations to extract critical image features, including magnitude spectrum and phase spectrum, enabling efficient pattern recognition and noise reduction.

(3)-Applied various filtering techniques such as Gaussian low-pass filters, high-pass filters, and Butterworth filters, achieving significant improvement in image clarity and feature enhancement.

(4)-Automated the process of adding noise, transforming images into the frequency domain, applying filters, and reconstructing images through the Inverse Fourier Transform (IDFT).

(5)-Utilized MATLAB for zero-padding and spectral centering to optimize resolution and reduce convolution artifacts.

(6)-Contributed to real-world applications such as image restoration, compression, and segmentation, demonstrating expertise in both mathematical principles and practical implementations.
